# Motivation for this Project:

After manually adding thousands of hosts to multiple Zabbix servers, I realized that the process was becomming increasingly time-consuming and was impacting my productivity. To streamline this process, I have invested significant time in leveraging the build-in Zabbix API and Python scripting to automate host management. 

These tools also enable junior developers and network administrators to roll out testing and monitoring to thousands of hosts within minutes, while also minimizing the risk of errors and inconsistencies in their configuration. By automating the host management process, we can create a more reliable and scalable monitoring infrastructure that can adapt to the changing needs of the network.


# Why use these tools?
1. Firstly, __Python__ is a powerfyl and widely-used programming language that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a large and supportive community that provides extensice documentation and resources, making it an ideal choice for developing automation scripts.

2. __PyZabbix__ is a Python library that provides a simplified interface for communicating with the Zabbix API. This library makes it easy to interact with the Zabbix API and perform common tasks such as retrieving host and trigger data, creating and updating hosts, and setting up monitoring templates.

3. Finally, the __Zabbix API__ provides a robust and flexible interface for interefacing with the Zabbix server. By using the API, you can automate tasks that would otherwise require manual configuration within the Zabbix user interface. This allows for faster and more efficient management of your monitoring infrastructure.

Together, these tools provide a powerful solution for managing hosts within the Zabbix Server.



# 3.) Installation:
### 3.1.) Python Installation:
* You should install the __pyzabbix__ library.
```
pip install pyzabbix
```

### 3.2.) Zabbix Server Configuration:
To stay in line with a secure zabbix server configuration, you should consider doing the following:

* Create a Zabbix User account, which has access to the API.
* Use this Zabbix user's credentials within the scripts in order to execute them.
* Remove the user account from the server after you are done with the scripts.

# 4.) How to use the project:
* Change the __ZABBIX SERVER URL__ within the code to your own Zabbix Server URL.
* Change the __ZABBIX ZERVER USER__ & __ZABBIX USER PASSWORD__ to the username and password you created earlier for the Zabbix API user.
* Run the specified script and watch the magic happen.
